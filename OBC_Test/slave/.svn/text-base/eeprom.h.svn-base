 * This is a bit simpler than the previous function since both, the
 * address and the data bytes will be transfered in master transmitter
 * mode, thus no reselection of the device is necessary.  However, the
 * EEPROMs are only capable of writing one "page" simultaneously, so
 * care must be taken to not cross a page boundary within one write
 * cycle.  The amount of data one page consists of varies from
 * manufacturer to manufacturer: some vendors only use 8-byte pages
 * for the smaller devices, and 16-byte pages for the larger devices,
 * while other vendors generally use 16-byte pages.  We thus use the
 * smallest common denominator of 8 bytes per page, declared by the
 * macro PAGE_SIZE above.
 *
 * The function simply returns after writing one page, returning the
 * actual number of data byte written.  It is up to the caller to
 * re-invoke it in order to write further data.

 * This requires two bus cycles: during the first cycle, the device
 * will be selected (master transmitter mode), and the address
 * transfered.  Address bits exceeding 256 are transfered in the
 * E2/E1/E0 bits (subaddress bits) of the device selector.
 *
 * The second bus cycle will reselect the device (repeated start
 * condition, going into master receiver mode), and transfer the data
 * from the device to the TWI master.  Multiple bytes can be
 * transfered by ACKing the client's transfer.  The last transfer will
 * be NACKed, which the client will take as an indication to not
 * initiate further transfers.
